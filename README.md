# PythonPhysics
What if high school physics was taught through python simulation?

# About Me
I am a high school physics teacher with an intermediate level of python experience. I have no formal CS education and I have never programmed professionally. I expect to lean on the expertise of any kind souls willing to contribute to this project. 

# About this project
The purpose of this project is to simulate all of high school physics using Python. My vision is for this to become what could best be described as a working textbook for exploring high school physics using python. This includes but is not limited to:

- VPython simulations of physical models
- Transformations of large datasets from both real world measurements and values collected through algorithm iterations

I see these simulations and transformations being folded between text explanations and descriptions using the Jupyter notebook filetype. 

# Why?
I've wanted to explore this project idea for some time now, as I see great value in high school physics students having at least some working ability in using python. I want my students to have the opportunity to think computationally about physics problems and I recognise that the vast majority of careers that a formal education in physics will lead to utilise computational power to test various hypothesise.

Ultimately, whilst viewing physics through the lens of python computation might not have a dramatic effect on their success in the short term (Although neither do I beleive that it will have a negative affect on their preparedness for the exams), I truly believe that it will help them in the long term.
